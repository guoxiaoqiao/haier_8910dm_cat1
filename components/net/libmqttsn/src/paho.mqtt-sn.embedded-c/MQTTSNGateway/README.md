**MQTT-SN** requires a MQTT-SN Gateway which acts as a protocol converter to convert **MQTT-SN messages to MQTT messages**. MQTT-SN client (UDP) can not communicate directly with MQTT broker(TCP/IP).

### **step1. Build the gateway**
````
$ git clone https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt-sn.embedded-c
$ cd paho.mqtt-sn.embedded-c/MQTTSNGateway
$ make
$ make install
$ make clean
````
MQTT-SNGateway, MQTT-SNLogmonitor and param.conf are copied into ../ directory.


### **step2. Execute the Gateway.**

````
$ cd ../
$ ./MQTT-SNGateway [-f Config file name]
````


### **How to Change the configuration of the gateway**
**../gateway.conf**   Contents are follows:

````

# config file of MQTT-SN Gateway

BrokerName=iot.eclipse.org
BrokerPortNo=1883
BrokerSecurePortNo=8883

ClientAuthentication=NO
#ClientsList=/path/to/your_clients.conf

#RootCAfile=/path/to/your_Root_CA.crt
#RootCApath=/path/to/your_certs_directory/
#CertKey=/path/to/your_cert.pem
#PrivateKey=/path/to/your_private-key.pem

GatewayID=1
GatewayName=PahoGateway-01
KeepAlive=900
#LoginID=your_ID
#Password=your_Password

# UDP
GatewayPortNo=10000
MulticastIP=225.1.1.1
MulticastPortNo=1883

# XBee
Baudrate=38400
SerialDevice=/dev/ttyUSB0
ApiMode=2
````

**BrokerName** to specify a domain name of the Broker, and **BrokerPortNo** is a port No of the Broker. **BrokerSecurePortNo** is for TLS connection.
**MulticastIP** and **MulticastPortNo** is a multicast address for GWSEARCH messages. Gateway is waiting GWSEARCH  and when receiving it send GWINFO message via MulticastIP address. Clients can get the gateway address (Gateway IP address and **GatewayPortNo**) from GWINFO message by means of std::recvfrom().
Client should know the MulticastIP and MulticastPortNo to send a SEARCHGW message.
**GatewayId** is used by GWINFO message.
**KeepAlive** is a duration of ADVERTISE message in seconds.
when **ClientAuthentication** is YES, see MQTTSNGWClient.cpp line53, clients file specified by ClientsList is required. This file defines connect allowed clients by ClientId and SensorNetwork Address. e.g. IP address and Port No.



### ** How to monitor the gateway from remote. **

Uncomment line32 in MQTTSNGWDefined.h.

`//#define RINGBUFFER     // print out Packets log into shared memory./"`
````
$ make
$ make install
$ make clean
````
restart the gateway.
open ssh terminal and execute LogMonitor.

`$ ./MQTT-SNLogmonitor`

Now you can get the Log on your terminal.
